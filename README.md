## Social-distance-monitoring
In this project, we present a real-time system for social distancing monitoring in public places. We use a mono camera setup that only provides the spatial coordinates of objects to the monitoring system. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm is used for object detection. We improve the YOLO algorithm by implementing the soft-non-maximum supression (soft NMS) algorithm over the usual NMS approach for enhanced bounding box suppression. The overall monitoring system is demonstrated to be suitable for monitoring social distancing in public places using video surveillance camera.
