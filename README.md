## Social-distance-monitoring
In this project, we have used a mono camera setup that only provides the spatial coordinates of objects to the monitoring system. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm is used for objectdetection. We improve the YOLO algorithm by implementing the soft-non-maximum supression (soft NMS) method over the usual NMS approach for enhanced bounding box prediction in the object detection algorithm. The overall monitoring system is demonstrated to be suitable for monitoring social distancing in public  places using video surveillance camera.
